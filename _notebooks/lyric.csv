Lyric,Song
You with the dark curls you with the watercolor eyes, Dear Arkansas Daughter
Look like Im going for a swim, Chun-li
Go ahead put my rhymes on trial, Intergalactic
The day the music died, American Pie
You got a 9-5 so Ill take the night shift, Night Shift
Always gonna be an uphill battle- sometimes Im gonna have to lose, The Climb
Day off in Kyoto got bored at the temple, Kyoto
He said if I keep it 100 that he keep me safe like a banker, Princess Diana
Every block boy needs a little love, What It Is
If I could get to sleep I wouldve slept by now, watch
Passed Alger Brook road, The View Between Villages
