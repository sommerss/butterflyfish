43/67 

q10- science museum tickets - i chose one that only adds when both conditions are true when it should really add when only one condition is true 

q32- calculate course grade- it should take it out of a count of one less than a length of the scores since one is being deleted

q36- park foot traffic simulation- i did not consider the benefit that was actually meant to be considered vs the overall benefits/disadvantages of modifying the simulation
